<sup>Tidbit series: How to explain Data Science concepts to anyone.
</sup>
&nbsp;

P-values are tricky to understand and easy to misunderstand. Great properties to become the most used statistical measure if you ask me!
Anyway, let's talk about it.

### Quick explanation

A quick first explanation I like is borrowed from [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjF4RKJ-m6s){:target="_blank"}: 

- _The lower the p-value is, the more likely someone was surprised by something._

The vagueness of that explanation is what I like about it. It conveys intuitively the limited explanatory power a p-value has in isolation. It is pretty much useless without the associated analysis and needs context to be valuable.

If that is not enough another approach I like is the conceptual explanation.

### Conceptual explanation

Let us dream for a second:<br>
When testing a Hypothesis, the best thing we could get is proof that what we test is true or untrue. A p-value can not give us that.<br>
The next best thing is the likelihood that something is true. A p-value can also not give us that.<br>
All a p-value does is the following: <br>

- _The p value tells you how plausible the explanation "The effect we see is just coincidence" is._

Why do we define it this way? The idea behind this is simple: Usually when you find an effect in the data there are 3 possible explanations for it:

1. The effect is real and that is why we see the effect in the data. (_duh_)
2. The effect is **not** real and the reason is some bias in the data / analysis / population.
3. The effect is **not** real and the reason is just random chance that the data turned out this way.

If we have a good study design (randomization or some other causal identification strategy can often be enough) we can eliminate case 2.<br>
A low p-value makes case 3 unreasonable as well. <br>
Voila! Only case 1 is left, and that is how you conclude that an effect is real with the help of p-values.

An explanation of why things are done this way leads us to the philosophy of how to quantify uncertainty in frequentist versus bayesian statistics, which could be the topic of another tidbit in the future.
