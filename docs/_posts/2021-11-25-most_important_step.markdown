What is the most important organ of the human body? Is it the heart? The lungs? Brain? They are all literally vital, so the question seems pointless, but I will try answering anyways. I am not a Doctor, I don't care.

Well not quite, I will give my opinion on what I think the most important step in a Data Science Use-Case is. This is also a complex system that combines many steps, all of which are vital for a Use-Case to produces business value.

My life may not depend on it, but which toothbrush Benny gets recommended does.

In my experience the most important part of a Data Science Use-Case is understanding the business question. There are 2 main reasons for this:

1. An approximate answer to the right question is better than an exact answer to the wrong question
2. Getting Buy-In from stakeholders is one of the hardest and most important things in Data Science. Show them that you understand the business makes them trust you and your recommendations more.

The obvious solution to this is learning more about the business. While I agree, it feels like there should be some better way of organizing it, since there are a lot of different
business understanding, data sources and pipelines, modeling, testing, deployment, presentation, a lot to ask

This is asking for a lot of one person. -> Data Science has a leraning curve that stays steep for a long time. Knowing more after you already know a lot  can have a big effect.
