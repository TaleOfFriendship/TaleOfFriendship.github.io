There is this stereotype that athletes are dumb and smart people are bad at sports. I want to show that even in a world where intelligence and athleticism is completely uncorrelated it would look like this stereotype is true.

Let us assume for a second that intelligence and athleticism has no correlation whatsoever. Then a graph plotting humans along both axis could look something like this:

One way of explaining it is collider bias.<br>

The principle behind it is that it is more likely to know famous people and famous people are more likely to be exceptional in a certain area.
