<p>What is the most important organ of the human body? Is it the heart? Maybe the lungs? The Brain could be a good choice,too. They are all vital, so the question seems pointless, but I will try answering anyways. Well, not exactly this question, I am not a Doctor, but I will answer the Data Science version of it.</p>

<p>A working Data Science solution also combines many working parts, all of which are vital for a Use-Case to produce value. My life may not depend on it, but which toothbrush Benny gets recommended does.</p>

<p>In my experience, the most important part of a Data Science Use-Case is understanding the business question. There are 2 main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An approximate answer to the right question is better than an exact answer to the wrong question. (Quote by Tukey)</li>
  <li>Getting Buy-In from stakeholders is one of the hardest and most important things in Data Science. Show them that you understand the business makes them trust you and your recommendations more.</li>
</ol>

<p>The obvious solution to this is learning more about the business. So if I have the goal of improving a Use-Case and I have the choice of improving my understanding of one of the areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business</li>
  <li>data sourcing and pipelines</li>
  <li>modeling</li>
  <li>software engineering and testing</li>
  <li>deployment</li>
  <li>presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>I often try to focus on the business side.</p>

<p>All of this is a lot to ask of one person, which is why most companies nowadays split them up into roles like Product Manager, Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer.</p>

<p>Of course, no one can be an expert in all of those things, but I think having a decent grasp on all of this helps in decision making and communication in your day-to-day if you work on Data products. <br />
-&gt; Data Science has a learning curve that stays steep for a long time. Knowing more after you already know a lot can still have a big effect. This is also one big reason I am drawn to this profession.</p>
