<p>What is the most important organ of the human body? Is it the heart? The lungs? Brain? They are all literally vital, so the question seems pointless, but I will try answering anyways. I am not a Doctor, I donâ€™t care.</p>

<p>Well not quite, I will give my opinion on what I think the most important step in a Data Science Use-Case is. This is also a complex system that combines many steps, all of which are vital for a Use-Case to produces business value.</p>

<p>My life may not depend on it, but which toothbrush Benny gets recommended does.</p>

<p>In my experience the most important part of a Data Science Use-Case is understanding the business question. There are 2 main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An approximate answer to the right question is better than an exact answer to the wrong question</li>
  <li>Getting Buy-In from stakeholders is one of the hardest and most important things in Data Science. Show them that you understand the business makes them trust you and your recommendations more.</li>
</ol>

<p>The obvious solution to this is learning more about the business. While I agree, it feels like there should be some better way of organizing it, since there are a lot of different
business understanding, data sources and pipelines, modeling, testing, deployment, presentation, a lot to ask</p>

<p>This is asking for a lot of one person. -&gt; Data Science has a leraning curve that stays steep for a long time. Knowing more after you already know a lot  can have a big effect.</p>

<p>??? Full Stack Data Scientist a new term</p>
